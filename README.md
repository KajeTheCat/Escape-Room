### Reality Escapes

1. Escape Reality is a virtual variant of the popular game escape room. We decided to take this adventure to an egyptian tomb to plunder the pharaohs crypt and extract his beloved treasure. Can you solve the riddles and make it out, before the pharaohs spirit retrieves your soul? The player's goal is to raid the tomb and recover Ramses' lost treasure. This will be achieved by locating four symbols, one in each of the rooms, and answering the riddle given. Once four riddles are solved and the lights turn green, the player has succeeded.

1. Game Lore: Long ago, the young pharaoh of the land, Ramses, grew hungry with power. Ramses collected all sorts of treasures from the lands his men had torn asunder, thus aquiring a large hoard of gold and trinkets. His next in line, greedy as he was, poisoned the pharaoh and his wife to aquire the hoard himself. Osiris, god of death, was amused by the greed the heir had shown and sent an assassin after the heir. The next heir to succeed them claimed the treausre hoard was cursed and buried it away with the old pharaoh. Present day comes, and it's time to unravel the mystery behind the curse. You are selected to delve into the tomb, solve the riddles, and locate this treasure hoard to see for yourself if Osiris truly cursed the gold, or if it was just the heirs greed.

1. The game itself was developed using simple languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! We implemented local storage functionality using JSON to save your time and name on the wall of successful explorers. In active development is a new iteration where we would implement, Phaser.js framework to make the game much more interactive. We are also exploring using mission learning and AI algorithm, to optimize the game engine.
