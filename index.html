        <p>Welcome to Escape Reality, Enjoy the brain teasers and sieze the treasure in this fun little interactive game
            built to kill a bit of boredom. Your goal is to raid the tomb and recover Ramses' lost treasure. This will
            be achieved by locating four symbols, one in each of the rooms, and answering the riddle given. Once four
            riddles are solved and the lights turn green, you've succeeded.
            <br> Long ago, the young pharaoh of the land, Ramses, grew hungry with power. Ramses collected all sorts of
            treasures from the lands his men had torn asunder, thus aquiring a large hoard of gold and trinkets. His
            next in line, greedy as he was, poisoned the pharaoh and his wife to aquire the hoard himself. Osiris, god
            of death, was amused by the greed the heir had shown and sent an assassin after the heir. The next heir to
            succeed them claimed the treausre hoard was cursed and buried it away with the old pharaoh. Present day
            comes, and it's time to unravel the mystery behind the curse. You are selected to delve into the tomb, solve
            the riddles, and locate this treasure hoard to see for yourself if Osiris truly cursed the gold, or if it
            was just the heirs greed.
