### Reality Escapes
1. Escape Reality is a virtual variant of the popular game escape room. We decided to take this adventure to an egyptian tomb to plunder the pharaohs crypt and extract his beloved treasure. Can you solve the riddles and make it out, before the pharaohs spirit retrieves your soul? The game itself was developed using simple languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! We implemented local storage functionality using JSON to save your time and name on the wall of successful explorers. In active development is a new iteration where we would implement, Phaser.js framework to make the game much more interactive. We are also exploring using mission learning and AI algorithm, to optimize the game engine.
